Welcome to my blog!

I don't plan to post too often, but every now and then I may shove something up here.

As you can tell from the footer, I set this blog us using [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog).
It is really easy to set up, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to just toss it up.

That is the post, why are you still here?
